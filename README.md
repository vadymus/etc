### COVID-19 Vaccine Related Concerns

> This space is neither a forum for anti-vaxxers nor conspiracy theorists. Only scientific proofs and references to questionable facts are listed below to help us be more aware of COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine effectiveness. 

#### Myopericarditis (Heart Deasese) Risks

Per CDC data as of August 18, 2021, people from 12 to 50 years old are exposed to myopericarditis - the heart desease. Myopericarditis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) with concurrent involvement of the adjacent myocardial layer. Myopericarditis usually presents similarly to pericarditis with chest pain, fever, and shortness of breath. Note, that young children are in the highest risks, especially boys, of this heart desease per CDC data.

#### Taiwan suspends 2nd dose Pfizer Covid vaccine for 12-17 ages amid myocarditis cases

Taiwan’s health minister Chen Shih-chung has said that they are suspending administering second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT) Covid vaccine to children in the 12-17 age group amid concerns that it may increase the risk of myocarditis.

#### Death Rates for Vaccinated vs Unvaccinated

On October 7, 2021, the death toll after vaccination in Taiwan reached 852, while the death toll after the COVID-19 was diagnosed was 844. The number of deaths after vaccination exceeded the number of confirmed deaths for the first time.

Covid-19 infection death rate is 0.03% for 35 year old. See your age group below. Covid-19 survival rate is 99.99%.

#### Increased Hospitalizion of Vaccinated

Per CDC, there is an increased percentage of vaccinated pesons among those hospitalized 

![Increased Hospitalizion of Vaccinated](assets/increased-hospitalizion-of-vaccinated.png)

Even though vaccinations offers protection to individuals against severe hospitalization and death, the CDC reported an increase from 0.01 to 9% and 0 to 15.1% (between January to May 2021) in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths, respectively, amongst the fully vaccinated.

#### More Covid-19 Cases in Highly Vaccinated Countries

National Institutes of Health states, at the country-level, there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases. In fact, the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID-19 cases per 1 million people. Notably, Israel with over 60% of their population fully vaccinated had the highest COVID-19 cases per 1 million people in the last 7 days.

#### Vaccine Effectiveness Concern

Protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to wane rapidly following its peak after the second dose, but protection against hospitalization and death persisted at a robust level for 6 months after the second dose.

#### Study shows dramatic decline in effectiveness of all three COVID-19 vaccines over time

As the Delta variant became the dominant strain of the coronavirus across the United States, all three COVID-19 vaccines available to Americans lost some of their protective power, with vaccine efficacy among a large group of veterans dropping between 35% and 85%, according to a new study.

#### Florida Summit on COVID

The Florida Summit on COVID included doctors from throughout the U.S. who discussed the vaccines, natural immunity in those who previously had the virus, vaccine mandates and related topics. Some takeaways are:
- Under no circumstances children should be vaccinated. 
  - Children are not in high risk but, if vaccinated, they have higher risks of heart disease - myopericarditis.
- Do not vaccinate those who was sick with COVID-19 virus. 
  - Natural immunity is superior to vaccines and lasts much longer.
- CDC and government should not interfere with doctors' treatments agaist COVID infections.

### At least 69 athletes collapse in one month, many dead

The reports of athletes who suddenly collapse have been increasing noticeably lately. Heart problems such as heart inflammation are often the cause – one of the known life-threatening side effects of Covid vaccines, which even the manufacturers themselves warn against.
